My first kotlin introduction

For the persons that will look to this as the outcome of a interview challange to get the job, sorry guys, too far from the expected outcome for a senior on kotlin, but again, this was my first try out, done on my free hours (who knows me knows what that means), so no kotlin senior here :P
Anyway, this is not over. Although I'm not convinced yet that kotlin will be the future reference of android development (I have my reasons), I think that learning a little bit will not hurt for sure, and who knows, maybe I'm wrong and that will be my main skill...
For curious like me, just try it out, always a chance to see other ways to do things, other approaches.

So thank you Ana and the mistery company behind for the challange, you pushed me and for sure that value was and will be added to the developer in me.
